        <h3> <i>Model UN</i> </h3>
            <p>I learned what Model UN was last year when all the freshman had to do a miniature conference. Model UN is a simulation of the UN General Assembly where all the kids represent a figure/country and debate numerous different topics. Austin High has its own conference with other highschools known as "AUSMUN" </p>
